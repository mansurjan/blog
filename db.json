      "body": "Telegram's previous update revolutionized emoji, adding an open platform for creating custom animated emoji. This update gives you even more ways to use these new emoji to express how you're feeling – with infinite reactions and emoji statuses.\n\nInfinite Reactions\nAll users now have access to dozens of reactions – including those that were previously only available with Telegram Premium, like 🤣 😐 🐳. To accommodate all the new emoji, we've redesigned the reaction panel, making it expandable. The reactions you use frequently will show up at the top.\n\nPremium Telegram Premium users can pick reactions from an infinite selection of custom emoji. To make choosing from thousands upon thousands of emoji easier, they can now attach up to 3 reactions per message.\n\nThese changes to reactions are currently available in groups and 1-on-1 chats.\n\nGroup admins can control whether custom reactions may be used in their groups.\n\nPremium Emoji Statuses\nStarting today, Premium users can add an animated emoji status that is displayed next to their name – to quickly let everyone know how they're feeling or what they're doing. This custom status takes the place of your Premium Premium Badge in the chat list, in your profile and in groups.\n\nYou can set one of 7 standard statuses that change their color to match different Telegram themes – or choose from an infinite number of custom emoji. Popular suggestions for working, sleeping, traveling and more will be shown at the top.\n\nTap the Premium badge at the top of your chat list or go to Settings to change your status. Press and hold an emoji to set a status for a specific duration.\n\nAnyone can use Telegram's open emoji platform to upload custom packs with unique art styles and characters for Telegram Premium users.\n\nImproved Login Flow\nUsers who log out and log back in frequently can now receive login codes through their email address or using Sign in with Apple or Sign in with Google.\n\nSigning up or logging in to Telegram on iOS is now even more streamlined, with new interfaces and fun animations that are already familiar to our Android users.\n\nNew Username Links\nAll @usernames on Telegram have their own t.me/username links, making it easy to share your public profile, group or channel anywhere on the internet.\n\nEvery username now has a new unique link format – username.t.me – for those who want to emphasize their name (or have trouble finding the / key).\n\nNew t.me links\nPrioritize Downloads on Android\nMedia and files that are actively downloading can be managed in the 'Downloads' tab of Search or by tapping the Downloads Android icon that appears in your chat list. You can now press and hold any items in the list to reorder them and change their priority – downloading the top file first.\n\nThis feature was already available on iOS – press and hold an item in the Downloads iOS list and select 'Prioritize Download'.\n\nAndroid Goodies\nNew smooth animations have been added for opening, closing and changing media on Android.\n\nThose on Android 13 or newer can choose a thematic Telegram icon that will automatically match your phone's dark mode settings and accent color.\n\nAndroid Icon\nAnd that's it for today. While everybody returns to their work and studies, we go back to our secret labs where the next update is already brewing.",

      "title": "Telegram Emoji Platform, Custom Animated Emoji Packs, Gifting Telegram Premium, and More",
      "body": "This summer, Telegram passed 700 million active users and introduced Premium Telegram Premium that lets anyone support the development of Telegram and get access to exclusive additional features.\n\nToday's update introduces the Telegram Emoji Platform, animated emoji in messages and captions, custom emoji packs, the ability to give Telegram Premium as a gift, a new privacy setting for voice messages – and more.\n\nPremium Custom Animated Emoji\nToday we're launching an open emoji platform where anyone can upload custom packs with unique art styles and characters for Telegram Premium users.\n\nThe new animated emoji can be included in the text of messages and media captions, adding even more emotion to your chats. Premium users get access to 10 initial custom emoji packs, containing more than 500 Premium emoji – and countless more coming.\n\nWhen you start typing a message, the Stickers Sticker button will turn into an Emoji Emoji button that opens the redesigned emoji panel – so you can quickly browse your emoji packs or add new ones.\n\nAll users – Premium or not – can see any animated emoji. Everyone can also use all custom emoji for free in their Saved Messages chat to try them out – or to add extra flair to notes and reminders.\n\nAll packs are included in emoji suggestions – type a shortcut like :smile or :lol and you'll see results from your entire library. Typing a static emoji will also show suggestions from all of your animated packs.\n\nInteractive Custom Emoji\nMany popular custom emoji are also interactive when sent in 1-on-1 chats – any user can tap to play synchronized, full-screen effects.\n\nTry it with common emotions like 😂😍😁😱❤️👍🎉 and more – like 💸🔥👻.\n\nNew Sticker, GIF and Emoji Panel on iOS\nThe sticker panel has a new look on iOS, with separate tabs for stickers, GIFs and emoji – just like on the Android, desktop and web apps.\n\nOn all apps, the GIF section now has thousands of high-quality GIFs from your favorite movies and shows – thanks to submissions from our recent contest.\n\nPremium Privacy Settings for Voice Messages\nPremium users have a new setting that allows them to control who is able to send them voice and video messages – like Everyone, My Contacts, or Nobody.\n\nPrivacy Settings for Voice and Video Messages\nLike other privacy settings, this also supports exceptions, so you can choose specific people or groups of users that can Never or Always send you voice messages.\n\nIf someone on your Always list chooses a bad time for verbal communication, you can convert their voice message to text.\n\nTo modify this setting, go to Settings > Privacy and Security > Voice Messages.\n\nPremium Gifting Telegram Premium\nIf you already have Telegram Premium, you can now share the experience with friends, family and coworkers by sending them a prepaid subscription for 3, 6 or 12 months – at a discount.\n\nOpen a user's profile and tap Menu iOS or Menu Android and choose Gift Premium. The gifted subscription will instantly arrive as a special message in your chat with that user – containing an animated gift box.\n\nIf you're using one of Telegram's desktop apps, or downloaded your Android app directly from our website, you can use bots like @PremiumBot to subscribe to Telegram Premium or give it as a gift.\n\nThe FAQ now has a dedicated section for Telegram Premium – where you can learn how to manage your subscription, what features it offers and why it makes you feel all warm and fuzzy.\n\nMore Interactive Emoji\nMaking new interactive emoji with full-screen effects is a good tradition and today we're adding 🍌🤨⚡️💔🏆😐. Send one of these into any 1-on-1 chat to get a big animated emoji that displays an effect when you tap it:\n\nThese emoji are also available as reactions – currently exclusive to Premium subscribers.\n\nAny user can increase the counters for exclusive reactions that were already added to a message by Premium subscribers.\n\nAnd that's all for today. Enjoy the rest of the Summer while we're back down in our dungeons – where it's always cool and the next update is already taking shape.\n\n",

      "title": "700 Million Users and Telegram Premium",
      "body": "Telegram became one of the top-5 downloaded apps worldwide in 2022 and now has over 700 million monthly active users. This growth is solely from personal recommendations – Telegram has never paid to advertise its apps.\n\nAs Telegram keeps growing at rocket speed, many users have expressed their will to support our team. Today we're launching Premium Telegram Premium – a subscription that lets you support Telegram's continued development and gives you access to exclusive additional features.\n\nThis will allow us to offer all the resource-heavy features users have asked for over the years, while preserving free access to the most powerful messenger on the planet.\n\nPremium Telegram Premium\nBy subscribing to Telegram Premium, users unlock doubled limits, 4 GB file uploads, faster downloads, exclusive stickers and reactions, improved chat management – and a whole lot more.\n\nAt the same time, all existing features that users have come to expect and rely on for nearly a decade remain free. Moreover, non-premium users will be able to enjoy some of Premium's benefits: for example, download the extra-large documents and view stickers sent by premium users, as well as tap to increase counters on premium reactions that were already added to a message.\n\nThe contributions of premium subscribers will help improve and expand the app for decades to come, while Telegram will remain free, independent and uphold its users-first values, redefining how a tech company should operate.\n\nPremium 4 GB Uploads\nAny user can upload large files and media, each up to 2 GB in size and enjoy unlimited storage in the Telegram Cloud for free. With Telegram Premium, subscribers will now be able to send 4 GB files – enough space for 4 hours of 1080p video, or 18 days of high-quality audio.\n\nAll Telegram users can download these extra-large documents, regardless of whether they are subscribed to Telegram Premium.\n\nPremium Faster Downloads\nPremium subscribers are able to download media and files at the fastest possible speed. You can access everything in your unlimited cloud storage as fast as your network can keep up.\n\nPremium Doubled Limits\nPremium users get increased limits for almost everything in the app. With Premium, you can follow up to 1000 channels, create up to 20 chat folders with up to 200 chats each, add a fourth account to any Telegram app, pin 10 chats in the main list and save up to 10 favorite stickers.\n\nDoubled limits for almost everything in the app\nYou can also write a longer bio and include a link in it. Similarly, Premium allows adding more characters to media captions. Finding the proper way to respond to any message will be easier with up to 400 favorite GIFs. Lastly, Premium users can reserve up to 20 public t.me links, making any group or channel you create stand out with a short and concise link.\n\nPremium Voice-to-Text\nVoice messages can be converted to text for those times you don't want to listen, but want to see what it says. You can rate transcriptions to help improve them.\n\nPremium Unique Stickers\nDozens of stickers now have impressive full-screen animations, which Premium users can send in any chat to add extra emotion and expressive effects that are visible for all users. This premium sticker collection will be updated monthly by Telegram artists.\n\nYou can quickly find Premium Stickers from all your packs in a dedicated section of your sticker panel, below 'Recently Used'.\n\nPremium Unique Reactions\nPremium users also unlock more ways to react to messages, with over 10 new emoji like 👌😍❤️‍🔥💯 (and the new favorites 🤡🌭🐳).\n\nPremium Chat Management\nTelegram Premium includes new tools to organize your chat list – like changing your default chat folder so the app always opens on a custom folder or, say, Unread instead of All Chats.\n\nTo change your default folder, press and hold a folder in your chat list > Reorder > and drag your preferred folder to the first space.\n\nAdditionally, subscribers can enable a setting in Privacy and Security to automatically archive and mute new chats, helping organize even the busiest chat lists.\n\nPremium Animated Profile Pictures\nThe profile videos of premium users will animate for everyone throughout the app – including in chats and the chat list. Let everyone see your new look, or flex your creativity with a unique looping animation.\n\nPremium Premium Badges\nAll premium users get a Premium special badge that appears next to their name in the chat list, chat headers, and member lists in groups – showing that they help support Telegram and are part of the club that receives exclusive features first.\n\nPremium Premium App Icons\nNew icons are available that premium users can add to their Home Screen to better match their personality or wallpaper. Choose from a premium star, night sky, or turbo-plane.\n\nPremium app icons\nPremium No Ads\nIn some countries, Sponsored Messages are shown in large, public one-to-many channels. These minimalist, privacy-conscious advertisements help support Telegram's operating costs, but will no longer appear for subscribers of Telegram Premium.\n\nPremium subscriptions help Telegram pay not only for the additional expenses of premium features, but also support the free version of Telegram for everyone.\n\nImprovements for Everyone\nWhile we are going to release more exciting features for Premium subscribers, we will keep implementing free features available for everyone, and do it faster than any other massively popular app. This update is no exception – it adds join requests for public groups, an animated screen for external sharing, improved bot descriptions, and more.\n\nJoin Requests for Public Groups\nPublic groups can now enable join requests – allowing group admins to review new members before approving them to write in the chat. Users who open the group can tap Request to Join, adding their request to a list that only admins can access.\n\nRequest to join a public group\nAdmins can reach out to users who want to join and have a chat to cover the rules, make sure they're a good fit or even plan a welcome party. When an admin reaches out, Telegram lets the user know they're reaching out as a group admin.\n\nOwners of public groups can enable join requests via Group Info > Edit > Group Type > Who Can Send Messages > select Only Members > enable Approve New Members.\n\nVerification Badges in Chats\nPublic figures and organizations can verify their group, channel or bot – receiving a verification badge Verification Check to show users that messages are coming from a confirmed source. In addition to profiles, search results and the chat list, these badges now appear at the top of the chat. This makes it even easier to identify verified sources of information.\n\nIf you're verified on at least two social networks, you can verify your group, channel or bot.\n\nBetter Bots\nBots on Telegram can help you take quizzes, accept payments and even replace whole websites. Bot developers can now include a photo or video in the “What can this bot do?” section of their bots to show off their features.\n\nWhat can this bot do?\nBots that are integrated into the Attach attachment menu can now also work in groups and channels in addition to one-on-one chats.\n\nThe Bot API is a free and open platform, available to everyone. If you're looking to build your own bot, check out this page.\n\nImproved Chat Previews on Android\nThis update brings improved chat previews on par with iOS. Now you can scroll through them to view the whole chat without marking it as read. New buttons have been added to let you mark the chat as read, mute it, pin it or delete it.\n\nTo preview a chat, simply press and hold its profile picture in your chat list.\n\nAutomatic Saving to Gallery on Android\nThe option to automatically save media to Gallery is back with renewed vigor: saving media can now be enabled and disabled separately for chats with users, groups or channels.\n\nSave to Gallery Settings on Android\nImproved External Sharing on iOS\nWith the ability to send files up to 2 GB (or 4 GB), users can easily share large media items from other apps directly to Telegram on any mobile platform. This saves both time and storage space – so you don't have to save the file before sending it in Telegram.\n\nWhen sending large files shared from another app on iOS, you can now watch an animated progress bar to find out if you have enough time for a tea or if you should stick with espresso.\n\nAnimated Profile Picture Creator on macOS\nUsers on macOS now have a quick way to generate a custom profile picture – choose any sticker or animated emoji as the focus, and add a colorful gradient background. You can set one for your own profile, or as a group or channel photo – making it easy to create a themed icon for chats without searching for stock photos.\n\nTo create one of these, go to Settings or a Chat Info page, click Edit > click the Profile Picture > select Sticker or Emoji.\n\nFaster and Stronger\nThis update includes over 100 fixes and optimizations to the mobile and desktop apps – eliminating bugs, improving speed, and expanding minor features. iOS users with the latest iPhones and iPads get significantly smoother animations (120 FPS) throughout the app. Android users will notice better audio and video quality in voice and video messages, along with options to set alternative app icons, clear all recent stickers at once and translate user bios or chat descriptions.\n\nThis update is being rolled out gradually. If your app is not offering you to update, please wait – the new version will become available soon.\n\nThank You\nToday is an important day in the history of Telegram – marking not only a new milestone, but also the beginning of Telegram's sustainable monetization. We believe that Telegram's development should be driven primarily by its users, not advertisers. This way our users will always remain our main priority.",

      "title": "Notification Sounds, Bot Revolution and More",
      "body": "Today's update adds creating your own notification tones, setting custom durations for muting chats or auto-deleting messages, as well as supercharged bots ready to outshine any website, improved forwarding that preserves replies, and a lot more.\n\nCustom Notification Sounds\nYou can now turn any sound into a notification tone, creating custom alerts from your favorite music or even memes (and meows). Tap a short audio file or voice message in chat to instantly add it to your list of notification sounds, which you can assign to any chats.\n\nTelegram tones are cross-platform and completely free – as they should be.\n\nYou can access your sounds on all your devices via Settings > Notifications and Sounds. There you can add new tones and set sounds for individual chats or entire groups of chats.\n\nTones currently support audio files and voice messages under 5 seconds up to 300 KB in size. Try some samples made by our team (and their pets) in the Notification Sounds channel.\n\nCustom Mute Durations\nFor years, Telegram users have been able to temporarily mute chats to take a break from notifications, like for 8 hours or 2 days. Now you can also pause notifications for a specific duration, like the length of a midday nap or extended vacation.\n\nEach chat has a streamlined menu for modifying alerts – choose Disable Sound to receive notifications silently, or one of the Mute options to turn off notifications completely.\n\nOn Android, tap 'Notifications' on a chat's info page or Menu Android > Mute in the chat header. On iOS, tap 'Mute' on a chat's info page.\n\nNew Auto-Delete Menu in Profiles\nAuto-Delete can be enabled in any chat to make a conversation more confidential or less cluttered. Now it takes fewer taps to enable and supports flexible timer settings – like 2 days, 3 weeks, 4 months, and more.\n\nEnable Auto-Delete from Menu Android or Menu iOS on a chat's info page.\n\nReplies in Forwarded Messages\nTelegram was the first app to make replies easy and efficient to navigate (2015). Swipe left on any message to reply to it. Your reply will include a small preview you can tap to instantly jump to the original message.\n\nThese same reply previews are now included when forwarding messages to other chats, so everyone can see the full context of your inside jokes.\n\nYou can always hide the sender's name or media captions if you want to forward a message more anonymously.\n\nBot Revolution\nSince 2015, millions of people have utilized bots to convert files, shop online and even pay their taxes. Telegram bots already support seamless authorization, processing payments via 15 integrated payment providers (with Google Pay and Apple Pay out of the box), collecting feedback, delivering tailored notifications to users, and much more.\n\nToday we're adding an entire new dimension, giving bot developers the tools to create infinitely flexible interfaces with JavaScript, one of the most popular programming languages in the world. With this, Telegram bots can completely replace any website.\n\nTo get an idea of what to expect from third-party Telegram bots, try ordering fictional fast food with our sample @DurgerKingBot.\n\nDevelopers are welcome to study the Bot API documentation – and let their imagination run wild.\n\nThese interfaces can be programmed to match a user’s theme – adjusting color schemes in real time, for example when switching between Day and Night modes or setting custom themes.\n\nInstantly Configure Bot Admins\nTelegram bots can also handle small tasks like chat management by adding extra features, automating processes or helping moderators. Users can now quickly add bots to their group or channel right from the bot's profile and instantly configure rights and permissions for the bot.\n\nBots can only be added to channels as admins, while bots can be added to groups as both members or admins.\n\nImproved Message Translation on iOS\nThe in-app translation feature for iOS devices has been expanded to support better quality translations from many more languages, such as Ukrainian – and is now able to translate the same languages as the Android app.\n\nEnable Translation in Settings > Language to add a dedicated Translate button to the context menu when selecting a message. You can also exclude any languages you speak fluently – which will hide the translate button for those messages.\n\nImproved Picture-in-Picture on Android\nAny video on Telegram's mobile apps can be viewed Picture-in-Picture, so you can keep chatting while you watch live streams or cat compilations. This update adds improvements to the player window on Android – pinch to change its size, tap X to quickly close it, and enjoy the new rounded design.\n\nPicture-in-Picture videos work in Telegram apps on every platform – including iOS, macOS and Telegram Desktop.\n\nNew Animations\nThe interface for changing your phone number in Settings has a new look, with animated ducks to walk you through the process. Changing your account's phone number updates where we send future login codes – all your chats, media and other Settings will stay exactly the same.\n\nKeeping your number up to date is essential, so that you can always receive login codes and access your account. You can seamlessly change it by tapping your phone number in Settings.\n\nMore Animated Emoji\nIn case you're looking for Food That Moves, simply send a message with a single emoji to get one of these in a chat:\n\n",
